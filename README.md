# Characterizing Voting Preferences in French Communes: 2017 Presidential Elections

This project analyzes the voting preferences of French communes in the first round of the 2017 presidential elections. Using demographic and voting data from INSEE and Data.gouv, we applied K-means clustering to group communes based on their voting patterns and socio-economic characteristics.

# Summary

The analysis uses two clustering approaches:

Top 1 Candidate Clustering: Clustering based on the top candidate in each commune.
Top 3 Candidates Clustering: Clustering based on the top three candidates, providing a more nuanced view of political diversity.
We visualized the results through an interactive map allowing users to explore communes' political and socio-economic features, such as age distribution, education level, urban density, and income. These will be provided in HTML format in this repository.

# Conclusion

The clustering revealed distinct groups of communes with shared characteristics. Urban areas (Cluster 0) lean center-right with support for Macron, communes surounding the urban areas show an almost absolute support for Le PEN, while more rural areas show stronger preference for Lassalle. This analysis highlights the socio-political divisions across France, driven by economic conditions and urbanization.
